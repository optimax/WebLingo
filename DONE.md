# DONE WebLingo

The tasks from [`TO-DO.md`](TO-DO.md) that are done, each moved to the end of this file when it was marked [DONE] ([`TO-DO-INSTRUCTIONS.md`](TO-DO-INSTRUCTIONS.md)).

## [DONE] Duplicated Files

Two files exist twice in the repository (`Documents/implementation.md`, section 11):

- the architecture specification, `Documents/weblingo-architecture.md` and `WebLingo/docs/architecture/weblingo-architecture.md`, identical on 2026-11-12; the second is the canonical one (`WebLingo/docs/architecture/README.md`);
- `.gitignore`: the root one covers the whole repository, and `WebLingo/.gitignore` is a subset of it.

Q1: Shall `Documents/weblingo-architecture.md` be removed, leaving the canonical copy only, or is it kept on purpose (as your working copy, say), and if so, which copy do you edit?

A1: Only one should remain. Keep the folder structure shallow, so no `architecture `folder.

Q2: Shall `WebLingo/.gitignore` be removed, now that the root `.gitignore` covers it, or kept so that the solution folder has its own (for example, for when it becomes the public repository)?

A2: Yes, remove the redunadant one. Keep in mind that the entire repository can become public so don't put anything in there that should be kept private.

Done (Claude, 2026-11-12, `cb17fed`):

- **The specification** exists once, as `Documents/weblingo-architecture.md`, the copy at the shallower place. The copy in `WebLingo/docs/architecture/` is gone, with that folder's `README.md`, whose one rule (update the specification when a decision is approved) is in `Documents/implementation.md`, section 5. `M0.6.1-status.md` moved to `Documents/`, so `WebLingo/docs/` is gone too. `CLAUDE.md` and `WebLingo/README.md` point at the remaining copy.
- **`WebLingo/.gitignore`** is gone; the root `.gitignore` covers the solution (a build leaves `git status` clean).
- **Your decisions are recorded:** in the specification's decision register and section 8.2, and in `Documents/implementation.md` (shallow folders in section 3; the whole repository may become public in section 10, with what that rules out).
- The other nested document folder, `WebLingo/eng/portability/`, is a question of its own: "Shallow `eng/portability/` Folder".

## [DONE] Make the CI Workflow Run

`WebLingo/.github/workflows/build.yml` builds and tests on Windows and Linux, but GitHub Actions does not run it: it is in the solution folder, and Actions reads workflows only from `.github/workflows` at the repository root. Its commands also expect `WebLingo.slnx` at the root (`Documents/implementation.md`, section 11). Move it to the root and point its commands at the solution folder, so that M0.8's Windows and Linux CI (specification, section 9) has a start. It first runs on a push, which needs the user's go-ahead.

Done (Claude, 2026-11-12, `ea07107`):

- The workflow is `.github/workflows/build.yml` at the repository root. Its steps run in the solution folder (`working-directory: WebLingo`), and `fail-fast: false` lets both platforms report their results when one fails.
- Its three commands, run locally as written from the solution folder on Windows, pass: restore, Release build with no warnings, 5 tests.
- **The workflow itself has not run:** it runs on a push, which waits for your go-ahead (see "Verify the M0.6.1 Scaffold"). `Documents/implementation.md`, section 11, "CI Has Not Run Yet", says so until it has.

## [DONE] M0.6.2: Lexer and Tokenization Tests

The lexer of the specification, section 8.4 ("Lexer"): identifiers, the keywords `var` and `const`, literals, operators, punctuation, source spans, and diagnostics for malformed input, with tests. It replaces the M0.6.1 lexer seed in `WebLingo.Language`.

Done (Claude, 2026-11-12, `c20e0c2`):

- **`WsLexer`** reads identifiers, `var`, `const` and the reserved `let`, decimal integer literals (with their values, checked against int64), `+ - * / =`, and `; ( ) ,`, and skips whitespace and `//` and `/* */` comments. Malformed input gives a `Bad` token and a diagnostic, and lexing goes on, so one pass reports every lexical error: WS1003 invalid character, WS1004 invalid numeric literal, WS1005 unterminated comment.
- **`WsSourceText`** (`WebLingo.Core`) turns positions into one-based lines and columns, for the diagnostics of every later stage.
- **Literals:** M0.6's parser subset needs integer literals only. String, binary64 and decimal literals are not lexed, since the specification does not give their syntax yet: their characters are invalid. So `samples/HelloWorld/hello.ws`, which uses a string, will not compile in M0.6.
- **The choices** where the specification is silent are in its section 15.2, as Proposed, and asked about in "Lexical Choices (M0.6.2)".
- Tests: 53 new (lexer and source text), all passing on Windows; Linux not tried.

## [DONE] M0.6.3: Parser, AST and Diagnostics

The parser of the specification, section 8.4 ("Parser"): the initial subset of variable declarations, integer literals, identifiers, arithmetic, parentheses and mandatory semicolons, with source spans preserved and enough recovery to report several errors, and the diagnostics of section 8.4.

Done (Claude, 2026-11-12, `70081d4`):

- **`WsParser`** parses `var` and `const` declarations, with or without a value, and expression statements: integer literals, names, unary `-`, `* /` above `+ -`, parentheses, assignment and calls, each statement ended by a mandatory `;`. **`WsSyntax.cs`** is the tree; every node has its source span.
- **Diagnostics:** WS1001 unexpected token (with a hint when `let` is used), WS1002 missing semicolon (where the `;` belongs), and the new WS1006 `const` without a value, WS1007 invalid assignment target, and WS1008 nested too deeply. Recovery resumes at the next `;` or declaration, a lexical error is not reported again, and the diagnostics come in source order.
- **No crash on deep source:** recursion is limited to 256 levels and expressions to 1000 operations deep, so 100,000 nested parentheses or a 100,000-term sum is a diagnostic, not a stack overflow (the later stages walk the tree recursively).
- **`print(...)`** parses as an ordinary call; binding decides what `print` is (M0.6.4).
- **The choices** where the specification is silent are in its section 15.2, as Proposed, and asked about in "Syntax Choices (M0.6.3)".
- Tests: 47 new parser tests, all passing on Windows; Linux not tried.

## [DONE] M0.6.4: Binder and Lowered IR

The binder and the lowered IR of the specification, section 8.4 ("Binder/IR"): lexical symbols and the temporal dead zone resolved, a bound tree, and a lowered IR independent of the choice between a register VM and a stack VM (WS-BC002).

Done (Claude, 2026-11-12, `6228d5a`):

- **`WsBinder`** resolves names lexically into a bound tree. A block's declarations are known from its start, so a name used before its declaration refers to it (and the temporal dead zone makes that a runtime error). The host's built-ins come in through `WsCompilerOptions`, in a scope around the program's. Errors: WS2001 undefined, WS2002 duplicate (at the later name), WS2003 assignment to a constant, and WS3001 for an invalid call or a built-in used as a value; binding goes on after an error.
- **`WsLowerer`** gives the lowered IR, a tree that is neither register- nor stack-shaped. It follows each variable from its dead zone to declared-without-value to assigned, and keeps a runtime check only where a read or store is not known to be safe.
- **`WsCompilation`** runs parse, bind and lower, and stops at the first stage that reports an error.
- **`WebLingo.Compiler.Tests`**, a new test project: 32 tests, all passing on Windows; Linux not tried.
- **The choices** where the specification is silent are in its section 15.2, as Proposed, and asked about in "Binding Choices (M0.6.4)".

## [DONE] M0.6.5: Minimal Bytecode Generator and Verifier

The bytecode generator and the verifier of the specification, section 8.4: an executable in-memory module (serialization waits until the WBC encoding is decided), and a verifier that rejects invalid opcodes, operands, branches, constants and uninitialized temporaries.

Done (Claude, 2026-11-12, `30523da`):

- **The bytecode** (`WebLingo.Bytecode`, `WsBytecodeContracts.cs`) is an in-memory register instruction model, not WBC: 13 operations with operands A to D, a constant table, the built-ins a module imports by name and arity, and one function, whose instructions each have a source span, with its locals' names, for runtime messages. It replaces the M0.6.1 placeholder.
- **`WsCodeGenerator`** puts locals in registers 0 to n − 1 and temporaries above them, writes a result straight into the local that wants it, and copies a local only when a later operand assigns it, so evaluation stays left to right. **`WsCompiler`** runs the whole compiler and verifies its own output.
- **`WsBytecodeVerifier`** rejects unknown operations, operands out of range (registers, constants, imports, argument counts, branch targets), nonzero unused operands, code that can run off its end, and, by dataflow over every path, a temporary read before it is written. Its memory and steps are bounded, so a hostile module is rejected, never a crash or exhausted memory; a fuzz test of 20,000 random modules checks that it never throws.
- **`WsDisassembler`** shows a module as text (for tests now, and a later `weblingo disasm`).
- **`WebLingo.Bytecode.Tests`**, a new test project: 32 tests; and 15 code generator tests. All pass on Windows; Linux not tried.
- **The choices** where the specification is silent are in its section 15.2, as Proposed, and asked about in "Bytecode Choices (M0.6.5)".

## [DONE] M0.6.6: Minimal Register VM, Arithmetic, Locals and `print`

The VM of the specification, section 8.4 ("VM", "Runtime values"): execution of verified modules in an execution context (owner worker, cancellation, instruction and resource budgets, runtime services), null, Boolean, int64 and binary64 values, and `print` as a built-in the CLI registers, so that `weblingo run` runs section 8.4's example and prints `30`.

Done (Claude, 2026-11-12, `05fb485`):

- **`weblingo run samples/Arithmetic/arithmetic.ws` prints `30`.** `weblingo check` compiles and reports without running. Diagnostics read `file(line,column): error CODE: message`, and the exit code tells success (0), compilation errors (1), a usage error or unreadable file (2), and a runtime error (3).
- **Runtime values** (`WebLingo.Runtime`): `WsValue`, 16 bytes as section 4.1 targets, holds null, Boolean, int64 and binary64. **`WsOperators`** is the arithmetic every VM will share: checked int64 (overflow is WS3002), `/` giving binary64 (10 / 2 is 5.0), IEEE 754 for binary64. **`WsValueFormatter`** gives a value's text, never culture-dependent.
- **`WsVirtualMachine`** (`WebLingo.VM`) verifies a module, links its imports to the host's built-ins, and runs it in an execution context with its owner worker, a cancellation signal (WS3004), instruction and register budgets (WS3003), and the runtime services. A runtime error stops it, reported at the instruction's source span; nothing a module or a built-in does can crash it.
- **`print`** is `WsPrintFunction` in `WebLingo.StdLib`, registered by the CLI (`WsCommandLine`), which is the host.
- **Not runnable in M0.6:** `samples/HelloWorld` (a string) and `samples/SimpleWebsite` (a template).
- **Tests:** `WebLingo.Runtime.Tests` (45) and `WebLingo.VM.Tests` (25), new projects; all 254 tests pass on Windows; Linux not tried. The CLI was run by hand on the samples and on files with compilation and runtime errors, for each exit code.
- **The choices** where the specification is silent are in its section 15.2, as Proposed, and asked about in "Runtime and CLI Choices (M0.6.6)". The portability inventory now lists the facilities M0.6 uses.

## [DONE] M0.8: Machine-Checked Portability Inventory

The approved WS-P016 asks for the portability inventory and CI checks (specification, sections 7.14 and 1.1), and the inventory says automated API checks remain future work. Check the portable core's built assemblies against `WebLingo/eng/portability/NativeCompatibility.md` in a test, so that CI fails when portable code uses what the inventory rules out: `System.IO` file access, the console, `Reflection.Emit`, P/Invoke, OS threads, .NET `Task`/`ValueTask` and `CancellationToken`, ADO.NET, ASP.NET Core, `System.Net.Http`, and LINQ (which the inventory keeps out). Added by Claude, 2026-11-12, from the specification's roadmap (`Documents/implementation.md`, section 13).

Done (Claude, 2026-11-12, `37d2925`):

- **`PortabilityTests`** (`WebLingo.Architecture.Tests`) reads the type references of the ten portable assemblies, and fails on any type the inventory rules out for the core, or on a P/Invoke. Besides the list above, it rules out `System.IO.Path` and `System.Environment`, which tie code to the platform. A self-test checks that it does find such uses (in its own assembly, which reads files and uses LINQ).
- **The inventory** has a row for every rule the test enforces, and says what is checked, where a new rule goes, and that its "Planned" rows are obligations on the Native C# toolchain, not checks.
- **The specification:** M0.8 is "Started" in section 9: CI configured (not yet run), and the dependency and portability checks in place.
- All 305 tests pass on Windows; Linux not tried.

## [DONE] Verify the M0.6.1 Scaffold

The specification's next activity (section 9): validate M0.6.1 with `dotnet restore`, `dotnet build` and `dotnet test` on Windows and Linux. Then update what reports its verification as pending: `WebLingo/README.md` ("Verification status"), `Documents/M0.6.1-status.md`, and the specification's sections 9 and 14.

Windows done (Claude, 2026-11-12, `f0ee564`): a fresh clone of `main`, with .NET SDK 10.0.404, restores, builds in Release with no warnings, and passes its 5 tests, and `weblingo --version` answers. `WebLingo/README.md`, `Documents/M0.6.1-status.md` and the specification (header, section 9, section 14) say so, and say that Linux is not verified yet.

Linux waits for the CI workflow's first run (`.github/workflows/build.yml`, since "Make the CI Workflow Run"), which runs on a push. There is no Linux here to try it on.

Q: May I push `main` to GitHub (`optimax/WebLingo`), so that CI runs on Linux and Windows? Everything committed since `e45fa73` would go: the agent files, `Documents/implementation.md`, the one specification, the CI move, and the M0.6 work done by then. Pushing needs your go-ahead (`AGENTS.md`, section 16).

A: Yes.

Done (Claude, 2026-11-12): `main` was pushed (`e45fa73..5229806`), and CI's first run passed on both `ubuntu-latest` and `windows-latest`: restore, Release build and tests, in 1 minute 29 seconds. So M0.6.1, and everything up to `5229806`, builds and passes its tests on Linux. `WebLingo/README.md`, `Documents/M0.6.1-status.md`, the specification (header, sections 9, 14 and 15), the portability inventory and `Documents/implementation.md` (section 11, now "CI Runs Only on a Push") say so. The run's two warnings (actions on Node.js 20) are the task "Update the CI Actions Off Node.js 20". The logs, with the test counts, need a signed-in GitHub account and were not read; the steps' success is what was checked.

## [DONE] M0.6.7: End-to-End Conformance on Windows and Linux

The conformance tests of the specification, section 8.6, end to end, on Windows and Linux, and the M0.6 acceptance criteria of section 8.8.

Windows done (Claude, 2026-11-12, `93df634`):

- **`WebLingo.Conformance.Tests`**, a new project, runs every program of section 8.6 as a file through the `weblingo` command line, and checks its output, its diagnostic (code, line and column) and its exit code. It also checks that section 8.4's example and `samples/Arithmetic` print `30`, that LF, CRLF and CR give the same results and positions, and, by fuzzing, that 5,000 random sources give diagnostics (or run) and 5,000 mutated modules fail verification (or run), never a crash.
- **`DependencyTests`** (`WebLingo.Architecture.Tests`) checks the built portable assemblies against section 8.3's dependency rules, and that none of them uses ASP.NET Core, ADO.NET, `Reflection.Emit` or `System.Net.Http`.
- **Acceptance criteria:** the specification's section 15.1 now gives each of section 8.8's its status.
- 294 tests, all passing on Windows.

Linux done (Claude, 2026-11-12): CI's first run, at `5229806`, which includes all of M0.6.7, passed on `ubuntu-latest`. Every acceptance criterion of section 8.8 is now met, "Builds cleanly on Windows and Linux" included (specification, section 15.1).

## [DONE] Shallow `eng/portability/` Folder

Since "Duplicated Files" (`DONE.md`), documents live in `Documents/`, and the folder structure is kept shallow (`Documents/implementation.md`, section 3). One nested document folder is left: `WebLingo/eng/portability/`, holding only `NativeCompatibility.md`, the portability inventory. The specification names that path in its build conventions (section 8.5, approved with M0.6) and proposes `eng/scripts/` and `eng/ci/` beside it (section 8.2), so I left it where it is.

Q: Shall `NativeCompatibility.md` move to `Documents/`, with the specification's section 8.5 changed to match and `eng/` removed, or stay in `WebLingo/eng/portability/` as the specification has it?

A: Move to `Documents\`.

Done (Claude, 2026-11-12): the inventory is now `Documents/NativeCompatibility.md`, `WebLingo/eng/` is gone, and the specification (sections 8.2, 8.5 and 15.1), `Documents/implementation.md` and `PortabilityTests` say so. Build and 296 tests pass on Windows; Linux not tried.

## [DONE] Lexical Choices (M0.6.2)

Where the specification is silent, the M0.6.2 lexer made choices of its own, recorded as Proposed in the specification's section 15.2 (rows "Line terminators" to "Diagnostic codes"). Each is made in one place, so changing one is small.

Q1: Do these suit you, or which do you want otherwise? Lines end at CRLF, LF or CR; a column counts Unicode scalar values (a tab is one); whitespace is space, tab, CR and LF only; comments are `//` and `/* */` (not nested); identifiers are ASCII letters, digits and `_`; integer literals are decimal, leading zeros allowed (`007` is 7), at most 9223372036854775807; digits followed by a letter are one invalid literal, which keeps `10m` free for decimals.

A1: I made comments inline, in the document. If there are follow up questions, bring them up here, not in the document. Redact the document in-place with agreed upon choices without keeping history of those choices.

Q2: The new diagnostic codes are WS1003 (invalid character), WS1004 (invalid numeric literal) and WS1005 (unterminated comment). May they keep these codes?

A: Yes.

Done (Claude, 2026-11-12): no comments were found on the lexical rows of the specification's section 15.2, so they stand as written and are marked Approved, as are WS1003 to WS1005 (section 8.4, which now gives each code its status). Nothing in the code changed. Build and tests pass on Windows; Linux not tried.

## [DONE] Syntax Choices (M0.6.3)

Where the specification is silent, the M0.6.3 parser made choices of its own, recorded as Proposed in the specification's section 15.2 (rows "Statements" to "Diagnostic codes").

Q1: Do these suit you, or which do you want otherwise? No empty statement (a lone `;` is an error); unary `-` but no unary `+`; assignment is an expression (`a = b = 3`, and `print(x = 5)` prints 5) whose target must be a plain variable name; calls take no trailing comma; `const x;` is a syntax error.

A1: NO, I commented in the document where appropriate. Again, redact the document in-place with agreed upon choices without keeping history of those choices.

Q2: Nesting limits: parsing recurses at most 256 levels, and an expression is at most 1000 operations deep, beyond which the source is an error (WS1008) rather than a crash. Are these limits right, or do you want others?

A2: They are arbitrary, so make them easy to change constants in the implementation. 

Q3: The new diagnostic codes are WS1006 (`const` without a value), WS1007 (invalid assignment target) and WS1008 (nested too deeply). May they keep these codes?

A3: Yes.

Done (Claude, 2026-11-12): from the comment in the specification's "Operators" row, unary `+` is now accepted. It gives the number itself and is WS3001 on anything else, through a new `Plus` operation (parser, code generator, verifier, disassembler, VM, `WsOperators.TryPlus`), with tests. The code went into `06c82f1`, together with the lexical approval. The other syntax rows of section 15.2 had no comments, and stand as written. All of them, and WS1006 to WS1008, are marked Approved. The nesting limits were already the constants `WsParser.MaxRecursionDepth` and `MaxExpressionDepth`, and the specification now says so. Build and 300 tests pass on Windows; Linux not tried.

## [DONE] Binding Choices (M0.6.4)

Where the specification is silent, the M0.6.4 binder and lowering made choices of their own, recorded as Proposed in the specification's section 15.2 (rows "Compilation stages" to "Diagnostic codes").

Q1: The temporal dead zone at run time: reading a variable before its declaration has run, or a `var x;` before it is assigned, is a runtime error (WS2004), as the specification's `var x; print(x);` example says; so is assigning a variable before its declaration has run (as JavaScript does). Neither is reported at compile time, though in M0.6's straight-line programs the compiler could prove both. Is that what you want, or should provable cases be compile-time errors (or warnings)?

A1 (the user, in chat, 2026-11-12): No temporal dead zone. A name means its outer meaning until its declaration, which takes effect after its initializer; and every declaration needs an initializer, so `var x;` is a syntax error (WS1006).

Done (Claude, 2026-11-12, not yet committed): the specification's sections 1.1, 3.1, 8.4, 8.6 and 15.2 say so, and the code follows. `print(x); var x = 1;` and `var x = x + 1;` (with no outer `x`) are compile-time errors (WS2001), the VM's dead-zone checks are gone, and the verifier now requires every register, locals included, to be written before it is read. WS2004 is no longer reported. 296 tests pass on Windows.

Q2: The host's built-ins (`print`) are in a scope around the program's, so `var print = 1;` is allowed and hides the built-in. Should a declaration be allowed to shadow a built-in, or should that be an error?

A2: I changed `print` to `write` and introduced `writeLn`. Otherwise, built-ins should not be privileged in any way, so yes, allow shadowing.

Q3: Until functions are values, naming a built-in other than to call it is an error, and so is calling anything but a built-in, or with the wrong number of arguments: all WS3001, at compile time. Do they want codes of their own (say WS2005 "not a function", WS2006 "wrong number of arguments")?

A3: Yes. However, make sure that functions can be values (add to TO-DO?)

Q4: Evaluation is left to right, and an assignment evaluates its value before it stores it. Agreed?

A4: Yes.

Done (Claude, 2026-11-12): Q1 as recorded above. Q2: `print` is now `write`, with no line break, and `writeLn` writes a line break after the value (`WsWriteFunction`, `WsWriteLnFunction`). The output contract writes text as it comes (`IWsTextOutput.Write`). Samples, tests and documents use them. I guessed that `writeLn` takes one argument, like `write`. Built-ins stay unprivileged, and may be shadowed. Q3: calling what is not a function is WS2005, and calling with the wrong number of arguments is WS2006. Naming a built-in other than to call it stays WS3001 until functions are values, which is the new task "Functions as Values". Q4: approved. The "Checks" row is gone, per the comment on it. The specification's section 15.2 marks these rows Approved, and section 8.4 lists WS2005 and WS2006. `samples/Arithmetic` prints 30. `samples/HelloWorld` needs string literals, so it still does not compile. Build and 303 tests pass on Windows; Linux not tried.

## [DONE] Bytecode Choices (M0.6.5)

Where the specification is silent or only proposes, the M0.6.5 bytecode made choices of its own, recorded as Proposed in the specification's section 15.2 (rows "Instruction model" to "Diagnostic codes"). The bytecode is an in-memory model, not WBC, so none of them freezes a format.

Q1: The instruction set is 13 operations with up to four integer operands each, locals in the low registers and temporaries above them, and at most 65535 registers per function (section 5.3's proposed limit, enforced as WS4002). Does that suit you as M0.6's model, until the WBC encoding is decided?

A1: Yes.

Q2: Besides what section 5.5 asks, the verifier rejects nonzero unused operands, code that can run off its end, and a function whose check would need more than 16 million words of state or 100 million steps (rejected, rather than verified slowly). Are these bounds right?

A2: Sure, but make them adjustable via constants, as they too are arbitrary.

Q3: The new diagnostic code is WS4002 (program too large for the bytecode). May it keep this code?

A3: Yes.

Done (Claude, 2026-11-12): the specification's section 15.2 marks the instruction model, the registers, the operations and the verification as Approved, as is WS4002 in section 8.4. It also names the constants that hold the verifier's bounds and the register limit (`MaxStateWords`, `MaxSteps`, `MaxRegisters`), which already existed, so the code did not change. Nothing to build; Linux not tried.

## [DONE] Runtime and CLI Choices (M0.6.6)

Where the specification is silent, the M0.6.6 runtime, VM and CLI made choices of their own, recorded as Proposed in the specification's section 15.2 (rows "Runtime values" to "Diagnostic codes").

Q1: Arithmetic: an int64 meeting a binary64 becomes a binary64 (`10 / 4 + 1` is 3.5), and binary64 results follow IEEE 754, so `1 / 0` is `Infinity` and `0 / 0` is `NaN`, with no error; only integer overflow is an error. Or should mixing need an explicit conversion, or division by zero be an error?

A1: Mixing allowed within reason. Division by zero `Infinity` (1/0) or `NaN` (0/0). There need to be literals that mean `Infinity` and `NaN`.

Q2: The text of a number (what `write` writes): an int64 in digits; a binary64 as the shortest decimal that reads back as the same number, always with a point or an exponent (`5.0`, `0.1`, `-0.0`, `1E+21`), and `NaN`, `Infinity`, `-Infinity`. Is that the format you want (JavaScript would write `5`, `1e+21`)?

A2: Yes.

Q3: It is .NET's invariant `double.ToString("R")` that gives that text, so the Native C# runtime must give exactly the same, an obligation now in the portability inventory (`Documents/NativeCompatibility.md`, "Planned"). Is it acceptable for the core to rely on it until then?

A3: Yes.

Q4: The CLI's exit codes: 0 success, 1 compilation errors, 2 a usage error or an unreadable file, 3 a runtime error (M0.6.1's 3 meant "not implemented"); diagnostics as `file(line,column): error CODE: message`; `write`'s lines end in LF on every platform; `--version` says `WebLingo M0.6 (pre-alpha)`. Agreed?

A4: 2 seems to mean two different things. Separate them to make interpretation of the codes easier. Also note the change: `print` --> `write`.

Q5: The new diagnostic codes are WS3002 (integer overflow), WS3003 (budget exceeded) and WS3004 (cancelled). May they keep these codes? And a reading before initialization at run time keeps WS2004, from the compile-time 2xxx range: is that right, or should it have a runtime code of its own?

A5: Yes.

Done (Claude, 2026-11-12): the specification's section 15.2 marks the arithmetic, the binary64 results, the text of a value, the invalid operands (with your comment that `+` will also concatenate strings), the CLI and the diagnostic codes as Approved, as are WS3002 to WS3004 in section 8.4. The inventory records that relying on `double.ToString("R")` is approved until Native C#. Exit code 2 now means a usage error only; a file that cannot be read exits with 4 (`WsCommandLine.FileUnreadable`; the number is my guess), with tests and the README updated. The literals for `Infinity` and `NaN` need their spelling decided: that is the new question "Literals for `Infinity` and `NaN`". Build and 307 tests pass on Windows, and the CLI was run (missing file: 4, bad usage: 2, `samples/Arithmetic`: 30); Linux not tried.

## [DONE] Update the CI Actions Off Node.js 20

CI's first run (12 November 2026, commit `5229806`) passed, with a warning on both jobs: `actions/checkout@v4` and `actions/setup-dotnet@v4` target Node.js 20, which GitHub has deprecated and now forces onto Node.js 24. Move `.github/workflows/build.yml` to the actions' current major versions, which run on Node.js 24, checking the versions on their release pages first (`AGENTS.md`, section 4). It is tried on the next push, which needs the user's go-ahead. A notice says `ubuntu-latest` is moving to Ubuntu 26 (from 19 October 2026); nothing to do for that but watch the next runs. Added by Claude, 2026-11-12, from that run's annotations.

Done (Claude, 2026-11-12): `build.yml` now uses `actions/checkout@v7` (latest v7.0.1) and `actions/setup-dotnet@v6` (latest v6.1.0). Both release pages show that these majors run on Node.js 24 (`using: node24`). Their breaking changes don't affect this workflow: checkout's only change is for `pull_request_target` and `workflow_run`, and setup-dotnet's new global.json check doesn't apply, since the workflow passes `dotnet-version: '10.0.x'`. Not run yet: CI tries it on the next push, which needs your go-ahead.

## [DONE] Literals for `Infinity` and `NaN`

The owner's answer to "Runtime and CLI Choices (M0.6.6)", Q1: there need to be literals that mean `Infinity` and `NaN` (specification, section 15.2, "Binary64 results"). Today they arise only from division (`1 / 0`, `0 / 0`), and the language has no binary64 literals at all yet (`1.5` is not lexed). Added by Claude, 2026-11-12.

Q: How are they spelled? My proposal: two keywords, `Infinity` and `NaN`, spelled as `write` shows them, each a binary64 literal; `-Infinity` is then unary minus applied to it. Being keywords, they cannot be declared or shadowed, unlike the built-ins. The alternatives are predeclared constants, which a declaration could shadow as it can `write`, or a spelling of your own (`inf`, `nan`). Shall I add them as keywords, and should binary64 literals (`1.5`, `1e21`) come in the same task?

A: Yes, and yes.

Done (Claude, 2026-11-12): `Infinity` and `NaN` are keywords, and binary64 literals are lexed: `1.5`, `1e21`, `2.5E-3`, with digits needed on both sides of a point. I guessed two details, recorded in the specification (section 15.2, "Binary64 literals"): a literal too large for a binary64 is WS1004, and one too small becomes 0. They go through the lexer, parser, binder, IR and code generator (`WsBinary64LiteralSyntax`, `WsIrBinary64Constant`; constants are kept apart by their bits, so `0.0` and `-0.0` differ). The inventory gains a row for `double.Parse`. Tests cover lexing, errors and running. Build and 327 tests pass on Windows, and the CLI runs `writeLn(1.5 * 2); writeLn(Infinity - Infinity); writeLn(2.5E-3);` as `3.0`, `NaN`, `0.0025`. Linux not tried.

## [DONE] M0.7.1: Blocks and Nested Scopes

`{ statements }` as a statement, opening a scope, with shadowing (specification, sections 3.1 and 3.5). Added by Claude, 2026-11-12.

Done (Claude, 2026-11-12): `{ … }` is a statement through every stage (`WsBlockSyntax`, `WsBoundBlock`, `WsIrBlock`), and opens a scope in the binder. Error recovery stops at a brace, so an error inside a block does not swallow its `}`. A missing `}` is WS1001, reported at its `{` (my guess). Blocks count toward the parser's nesting limit. Each local still gets its own register, and inner blocks do not reuse them. Tests cover parsing, recovery, scope ends, shadowing and running. Build and 338 tests pass on Windows; Linux not tried.
